StarMap-PGx

Open Pharmacogenomic Interoperability Infrastructure

StarMap-PGx is an open pharmacogenomics infrastructure designed to connect star-allele nomenclature, genomic variants, rsIDs, and genome coordinates into a unified and reproducible resource for research and clinical use.

Problem

Pharmacogenomics relies on star-allele definitions (CPIC, PharmVar), but there is no standardized computational bridge between:

star alleles

defining variants

rsIDs

genomic coordinates

This limits reproducible pipelines and clinical implementation.

Solution

StarMap-PGx builds an open infrastructure that provides:

harmonized pharmacogenomic database

star allele → variant → rsID mapping

genome coordinate resolution (GRCh37/38)

public API

Python library

Initial genes

CYP2D6

CYP2C19

DPYD

SLCO1B1

Goal

Enable reproducible pharmacogenomics pipelines and support clinical translation worldwide.
