# StarMap-PGx  
Open Pharmacogenomic Interoperability Infrastructure  

---

## 🚧 Live development

StarMap-PGx is currently under active development.

First prototype release (v0.1) focuses on:

- CYP2C19 mapping  
- star allele → variant → rsID resolution  
- GRCh38 coordinate support  

Public demo and notebook coming soon.

## Project architecture

---

## Early adoption

StarMap-PGx is being prepared for testing in pharmacogenomics research workflows and clinical genomics pipelines.

We are collaborating with academic researchers and bioinformatics teams to validate early mapping results.

---

## Why support this project

Pharmacogenomics can prevent adverse drug reactions and improve treatment outcomes, but its implementation is slowed by fragmented data and lack of interoperable infrastructure.

StarMap-PGx builds the missing open layer connecting star-alleles, genomic variants, and clinical interpretation.

Your support helps:

- accelerate safer drug prescribing
- enable precision medicine adoption
- support open pharmacogenomics research
- build public infrastructure for global health

This project is fully open-source and developed as a public good.

## Problem

Pharmacogenomics relies on star-allele definitions (CPIC, PharmVar), but there is no standardized computational bridge between:

- star alleles  
- defining variants  
- rsIDs  
- genomic coordinates  

This limits reproducible pipelines and clinical implementation.

---

## Solution

StarMap-PGx builds an open infrastructure that provides:

- harmonized pharmacogenomic database  
- star allele → variant → rsID mapping  
- genome coordinate resolution (GRCh37/GRCh38)  
- public API  
- Python library  

---

## Initial genes

- CYP2D6  
- CYP2C19  
- DPYD  
- SLCO1B1  

---

## Goal

Enable reproducible pharmacogenomics pipelines and support clinical translation worldwide.

---

## Funding target

Initial micro-grant goal: $4,000

This funding will support:

- prototype mapping engine development
- initial dataset harmonization
- API prototype
- public demo release

All outputs will remain open-source.
